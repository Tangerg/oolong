# Every callable path needs executable evidence. For private functions, a deadcode
# finding is ordinary dead implementation. For an exported operation in a library,
# it means the public contract lacks a caller-side test or example — never that the
# operation is unnecessary. Public API is retained or removed only after reviewing
# its responsibility and abstraction independently of repository call counts.
